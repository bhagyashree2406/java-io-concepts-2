/**
 * Working of ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream
 * 1. The ObjectInputStream is mainly used to read data/object written by the ObjectOutputStream.
 * 2. Basically, the ObjectOutputStream converts or writes Java objects into corresponding streams(Output stream).
 *    Those converted streams can be stored in files or transferred through networks.
 *    This is known as `Serialization`.
 * 3. Now, if we need to read those objects, we will use the ObjectInputStream that will
 *    convert the streams back to corresponding objects. This is known as `Deserialization`.

//Stream is nothing but seq of elements or flow of data or pipe of data
//FileOutputStream -> writes into a file.
//ObjectOutputStream -> writes to Object Output stream.

//Input and Output that means Read and Write
//Input -> read data
//Output -> write data

/*
The goal of this program is to write the object using ObjectOutputStream
and FileOutputStream into a file and then read all the object from the
file using ObjectInputStream and FileInputStream
